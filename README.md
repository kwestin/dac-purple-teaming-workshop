# Welcome to Purple Teaming with Detection-as-Code for Modern SIEM 
This guide will provide you with a step-by-step of all the commands we will use throughout this workshop. Please reference it as we move forward. If you have questions, feel free to ask your group moderator.


## Lab 1 - Writing Our First Detection
Using the rule function and other pre-existing helper functions, creating a detection is extremely efficient in Panther. For this exercise, you will use the Panther console to create your first detection. 

**Terms we'll reference**
- [All Available Rule Functions](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther-analysis/blob/master/templates/example_rule.py)
- [What is a rule?](https://docs.panther.com/writing-detections/rules)
- [What are Helpers?](https://docs.panther.com/writing-detections/globals?q=helpers)
- [What is Deep_Get?](https://docs.panther.com/writing-detections/globals#deep_get)

Sample Okta Event - Failed Login:
  
```
{
	"actor": {
		"alternateId": "lemmy@heavymetals.io",
		"displayName": "Lemmy Kilmister",
		"id": "0u7gkf3fd41J4kku5d7",
		"type": "User"
	},
	"client": {
		"ipAddress": "111.111.111.111"
	},
	"eventType": "user.session.start",
	"outcome": {
		"reason": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
		"result": "FAILURE"
	},
	"p_event_time": "2023-01-23 09:59:53.650807",
	"p_log_type": "Okta.SystemLog",
	"p_parse_time": "2023-01:23 10:02:33.650807"
}
```


**Lab 1: Exercise 1**
1. In the Panther Console - Navigate to Build > Detections > Create New
2. Select "Rule" and give it a unique name "[YOUR NAME]'s Failed Login Detection" 
3. Select the log source "Okta System Log" and set Severity to "Medium"
4. Select Functions and Tests in the tab
5. Create a Unit Test and copy and paste the sample event from Okta above. We will use this to create our detection. 
6. Import deep_get function from the panther_base_helpers library ```from panther_base_helpers import deep_get```
7. Return the event for a login ```return event.get("eventType") == 'user.session.start'```
8. Return the event for a failed login result using the deep_get function ```deep_get(event, 'outcome', 'result') == "FAILURE"```
9. Final detection should look something like this. 

```
from panther_base_helpers import deep_get

def rule(event):
    return event.get("eventType") == 'user.session.start' and deep_get(event, 'outcome', 'result') == "FAILURE"

```


10. Let's set a threshold for this alert in the "Rule Settings" tab , so we only get an alert triggered if there are 5 failed logins within a 15 minute interval.

## Lab 2 - Data Onboarding, Packs & Detected Admin Console Access 

**Lab 2: Exercise 1: Onboarding Okta Data**
1. [Sign up for a free Okta Developer](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) account if you have not done so.
2. In your Okta Developer acccount go to Security > API and click on the "Tokens" tab
![Okta Token Page](/img/okta1.png)
3. Click "Create Token" and give it a unique name
![Okta Token Page](/img/okta2.png)
4. Copy the new token and past it somehwere safe as backup
![Copy Token](/img/okta3a.png)
5. Go to your Panther free trial instance and navigate to Configure > Log Sources and search for "Okta"
![Panther Log Source Configure](/img/okta5.png)
6. Enter a name for the log source, your developer acccount subdomain and the API key we just created and click "Setup"
![Panther Log Source Configure](/img/okta6.png)
7. Congratulatsions you just onboarded your first data source! 


**Lab 2: Exercise 2**
In this exercise we will write a new detection using what we have learned so far. If we look at the authenticaion logs there isn't any indicator the user is an administrator. However, once an admin logs in they are directed to the admin console which is logged as a seperate event. Log out of your Developer Okta instance and then back in. Go to Data Explorer and search for recent Okta event logs sorted in descending order. We will want to write a detection for when a user successfully logs into the admin console using what we have learned so far. Hint: Look for the eventType "user.session.access_admin_app." 

Extra points for using the ```def title(event) ``` function to add the admin's name to the title. You should see an event that looks like this in Data Explorer, we will copy and past that JSON into the test field of our detection.

## Lab 3: Exercise 2 - Modifying Existing Detections & Detecting API Key Creation
By utilzing a pre-packaged detection, we can easily modify an existing detection to tune to our environment. By using the python functions that Panther provides, code templates are easily available. 

**Terms we'll reference**
- [What are Packs?](https://docs.panther.com/writing-detections/detection-packs)


**Lab 3: Exercise 1: Enable Detection Packs**
1. Navigate to Build > Packs and search for "Okta"
2. Update and enable "Panther Okta Pack"
![Panther Okta Pack](/img/packs1.png)

**Lab 3: Exercise 2 **
1. In the Panther Console - Navigate to Build > Packs > Okta Pack
2. Select the Okta.APIKey.Created rule
3. Click on "Clone & edit"
4. Name the detection a unique name with your initials - Sample "Okta API Key Created - Brandon"
5. Grab the severity function from the templates page or below 
```
def severity(event):
    if event.get("field") == "value":
        return "INFO"
    return "HIGH"
```
6. Add the severity function into your detection. Anywhere under the rule function is fine. 
7. Copy over the test event with the sample log event from Okta Sample Data Below
8. Modify the severity function to return a "Low" event when the user is your own email or otherwise return a "High" event (Hint - you will have to use deep_get for this)
9. Test your changes using the unit test
10. Save Changes


**Okta API Key Created Log Event**

## Lab 4: Purple Teaming Detections

**Lab 4:  Exercise 1 - Installing & Running Dorothy (Optional)**
Dorothy is a tool to help security teams test their monitoring and detection capabilities for their Okta environment [created by David French](https://github.com/elastic/dorothy) [@threatpunter](https://twitter.com/threatpunter) at Elastic Security. 
<br>
Note: Dorothy does not use exploits or conduct any brute force, the tool requires an Okta access token.
DO NOT TEST THIS TOOL ON A PRODUCTION OKTA INSTANCE, PLEASE USE [YOUR OKTA DEVELOPER ACCOUNT](https://developer.okta.com/)   

Requirements: Python 3.7+, pip3 
1. Installing Dorothy 

* Option 1: Using pip3 by runnning ```pip3 install dorothy``` 
* Option 2: You can install [Dorothy from source code](https://github.com/elastic/dorothy) 

2. We will simulate the process of an attacker creating a new access token, go to your Okta developer instance and create a new access token, copy and paste it somewhere safe

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy_okta_key.png)

3. Now we will run Dorothy and configure a new profile, you will enter a description, the URL of your Okta dev instance, the access token you just created, you can store the token locally, do not store the logs in Elasticsearch.

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy1.png)

4. Once configured enter the command ```whoami``` to view the user and permissions tied to the access token, you should see that we have Super Administrator access. 

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy3.png)

5. We can list the available modules by entering the ```list-modules``` command 

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy2.png)

6. We will first create a new user first we go into the ```persistence ``` and then ```create-user```

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy4.png)

7. If we enter the ```info``` command we will see the parameters required for this module, we can set them with the ```set``` command followed by the appropirate required paramters for ```--first-name --last-name --email --login```. You can enter the ```info``` command again to verify the data has been added to the table. Next we will click ```execute``` you may need to enter this twice if you get an error the first time.

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy5.png)

8. We just created a regular user, however being the nefarious hackers we are we want to escalate this users privileges to administrator, in order to do that we need the Okta ID of that user. Enter the ```main``` command to go back to the main menu and then go into ```discovery``` and enter the ```get-users``` command and follow the prompt. This will dump all of the users, their permissions and unique Okta IDs. Copy and paste the ID for the user we just created somewhere.

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy6.png)

9. Now we will go back to the ```main``` menu then back into ```persistence``` and then we will select the ```create-admin-user``` module. Again we will execute the ```info``` command to see what parameters are required and you will see the only parameter needed is the ID of the user we want to elevate privileges for. As this access token is tied to a SUPER ADMIN account you have a lot of options with regards to the level of administration we can set for the key. We will select option 9 for SUPER_ADMIN.

![Okta Token Page](/img/dorothy7.png)


___________________________________________________

## Lab 5: Using Investigate and a Security Data Lake 

1. Now let's go back to Panther and go to Query Builder to see what data the activities in Dorothy generated, select the okta_systemlog table and click search. This will default sort to the most recent events first. 

![Query Builder ](/img/query_builder1.png)

2. In our results we should see some interesting events that indicate the creation of a new user as well as the escalation of that user's privileges. 

![Query Builder ](/img/query_builder2.png)

3. Based on what we have learned let's explore these events and write a couple of new detections: 

	- Write a detection that will trigger when a new user is created, include additional context such as the user(s) created. 
	- Write a detection that will trigger when a user's permissions are escalated and include additional context regarding who did it and what accounts were affected. 

Hints: look for these eventTypes ```user.account.privilege.grant``` and ```user.lifecycle.create```

<details>
	<summary>Click to view answer for accounts created </summary>

```
def rule(event):
from panther_base_helpers import deep_get

def rule(event):
    return event.get("eventType") == 'user.lifecycle.create' and deep_get(event, "outcome","result") == "SUCCESS"

def title(event):
    
    return "New account(s) created by  " + deep_get(event,"actor","displayName")


def get_display_names(event):
    rv = []
    target = event.get('target')
    for x in target:
        rv.append(x.get('displayName'))
    return rv

def alert_context(event):
    return {"displayName": get_display_names(event)}
```

</details>


<details>
	<summary>Click to view answer for privilege escalation </summary>

```
from panther_base_helpers import deep_get

def rule(event):
    return event.get("eventType") == 'user.account.privilege.grant' and deep_get(event, "debugContext","debugData","privilegeGranted") == "Super administrator"

def title(event):
    
    return "Privilege escalation by " + deep_get(event,"actor","displayName")

def get_display_names(event):
    rv = []
    target = event.get('target')
    for x in target:
        rv.append(x.get('displayName'))
    return rv

def alert_context(event):
    return {"displayName": get_display_names(event)}


```

</details>

**Bonus Lab - Scheduled Queries**

In addition to real-time detections, we can also look at data over a longer window of time via our Security Data Lake. Here we will create a scheduled query that looks specifically at a sequence of events leading to a successful brute force. The SQL statement has been provided to us by our threat hunting team, it leverages the Snowflake SQL ``` 
MATCH_RECOGNIZE()``` function. The query gathers successful and unsuccessful login events as well as client and user agent information from within the last 60 minute. This will look for failed logins followed by successful logins that we will want to look into as the account(s) in question may have been compromised. 

```
WITH
login_attempts AS ( -- filter for what we care about for speed
  SELECT
   p_event_time, 
   outcome:result AS outcome, 
   client:ipAddress AS clientIP, 
   client:userAgent.rawUserAgent AS userAgent, 
   actor
  FROM  panther_logs.public.okta_systemlog
  WHERE 
    outcome:result IN ('SUCCESS','FAIL','ALLOW','DENY')
    AND 
    p_occurs_since('60 minutes')
)

SELECT * from login_attempts
  MATCH_RECOGNIZE(
    PARTITION BY clientIP, userAgent, actor
    ORDER BY p_event_time DESC -- backwards in time
    MEASURES
      match_number() as match_number,
      first(p_event_time) as start_time,
      last(p_event_time) as end_time,
      count(*) as rows_in_sequence,
      count(row_with_success.*) as num_successes,
      count(row_with_fail.*) as num_fails
    ONE ROW PER MATCH
    AFTER MATCH SKIP TO LAST row_with_fail
    -- a success with fails following
    PATTERN(row_with_success row_with_fail+)
    DEFINE
      row_with_success AS outcome IN ('SUCCESS','ALLOW'),
      row_with_fail AS outcome IN ('FAIL','DENY')
  )
HAVING num_fails >= 8 -- how many fails must follow a success to qualify
ORDER BY clientIP, userAgent, actor, match_number
```
